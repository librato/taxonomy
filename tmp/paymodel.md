# License/Payment Model
## How do you want to pay for your tool:

## [Free/Open](free_open)
Opensource tools cost $0 to obtain and come with their source code. 

## [Commercial](commercial) 
Commercially licensed software often costs money to obtain (legally) and is
usually distributed in binary form. This category includes demo software that's
free-to-use for a limited time, as well as tools whose free-to-use tier are too
limited to run a small start-up on. 

## [Freemium](freemium) 
Freemium software is free to use but comes with a paid premium component or
usage tier.  SaaS tools that have a *usable* free tier can be found here. By
*usable* we mean the free tier provides the base-line operability a resonable
person would consider running a small startup on.

## [Free/Closed](free_closed)
Closed-source software that doesn't cost money to obtain.
