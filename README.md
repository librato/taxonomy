# A Monitoring Taxonomy

Hey! Welp, you found the Landing page for Librato's Monitoring Taxonomy
Project. Herein you'll find the source material for the Orielly book on the
same topic. 

[Part 1](/Part1) Summarizes the project's goals and background and introduces a
few fundamental Monitoring patterns that will help the new reader understand
how individual monitoring tools are described. It also has some apologist
claptrap about why your monitoring tool isn't covered here yet (don't worry,
you can totally fix that with a few PR's)

[Part 2](/Part2) Begins the monitoring taxonomy in earnest.
