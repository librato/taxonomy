#Part 1

## [Chapter 1](1.md): Why a taxonomy?
In this chapter we define the scope of the problem we’re trying to solve.
Namely, that the word “monitoring” is being used to describe myriad, often
tenuously-related efforts, and how, in the same way science relies on taxonomy
to make sense of a proponderance of organisms, our taxonomy will attempt to
create a single hierarchical structure to differentiate monitoring endeavors
for the purpose of helping engineers quickly identify the correct tool for
their needs.

## [Chapter 2](2.md): Monitoring Patterns 
In this chapter we’ll outline a set of monitoring patterns that are inevitably
followed by every monitoring tool. These include the centralized polling
pattern, process emitter/reporter, the stand-alone agent pattern, the rollup
pattern and more. Together these patterns give us a comman vernacular and
mental-model which will form a basis to help us briefly describe any individual
tool.

## [Chapter 3](3.md): The Data
At least initially, this work simply can't encompass every monitoring tool in
existence. In the interest of full visibility, this chapter will describe and
justify the selection process we're using to cover the monitoring tools we do.
