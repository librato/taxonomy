There are few things you need to know before we get started.

First, what you're holding in your hand is not the whole thing. This print
version only includes the 25 Open Source tools from the full Taxonomy. Think of
it as *the teaser*. The rest (62 tools in all) is online at
http://github.com/librato/taxonomy 

Second, this book was not intended to be read cover-to-cover. This is a
reference work. What I'm trying to do here is categorize your problem, and then
provide you some descriptions of monitoring tools that might help you solve
your problem. I'm not trying to fully document every monitoring tool, I'm just
trying to get you pointed in the right direction. See "How does this book work"
for a description of how we're going to do that.

Third, I didn't choose the tools that were included in this book. The tools
herein are self-selected based on their use in the real world by other
engineers like you. See "How did you choose the tools" below if you're curious
about why tool X was included but not tool Y.

=== How does this book work?

This book is predicated on the assumption that you hold in your mind a loose
set of requirements (or at least desires) for a monitoring system. Maybe you
need a Open-Source tool that can inspect sflow traffic and alert you about
bit-torrent happening on your network, or maybe you need a commercial byte-code
injection tool that can measure latency between your worker threads and your
kafka queue.  

Maybe you don't know exactly what you're requirements are, but you'd like to
weigh the options either way, or maybe you're aware of one popular tool and
want to find out about other tools that do the same thing. 

This book tries to help you out in any of those cases by categorizing your
problem, and then presenting you with a group of tools that might work for you.
We use a hierarchy, where you start by choosing how you want to manage the tool
(hosted?  On-prem?), and then how you want to pay for it and etc.. filtering
out the tools that don't apply to you as you proceed.

In this pamphlet, I categorize and describes 25 different open-source
monitoring tools along a path of 4 taxa. Then I provide a summary of each tool
in the form of a small questionnaire to give you a sense of how the tool does
what it does, how well it gets along with other tools, and how well it might
fit into your environment/culture/stack.

==== Lets get started. 
There are four top-level categories, and each have a varying number of
classification:

==== Operations Burden
Whom do you want to run your monitoring tool? The classifications are:

===== Traditional
Tools in this category are downloaded and installed on your network by you. 

===== Hosted
Tools in this category are run off-site for you by someone else. 

===== Appliances and Sensors
Tools in this category encompass vendor-provided hardware that is either
managed by the vendor or you, and other hybrid models that involve hardware. 

==== Pay Model
How do you want to pay for your monitoring tool? The classifications are:

===== Free/Open
Opensource tools cost $0 to obtain and come with their source code

===== Commercial
Commercially licensed software often costs money to obtain (legally) and is
usually distributed in binary form. This category includes demo software that's
free-to-use for a limited time, as well as tools whose free-to-use tier are too
limited to run a small start-up on.

===== Freemium
Freemium software is free to use but comes with a paid premium component or
usage tier. Commercial tools that have a usable free tier can be found here. By
usable we mean the free tier provides the base-line operability a resonable
person would consider running a small startup on.

===== Free/Closed
Closed-source software that doesn't cost money to obtain. Shareware and Nagware
tools can be found here.

===== Subscription Hardware
Appliances in this category typically provide the hardware for free, but charge
a monthly or annual subscription fee for use.

==== Activity Model
Do you need a tool to collect measurements, or process measurements or both?

===== Collectors
Tools designed primarily to measure things and make observations. This includes
things like monitoring agents, instrumentation libraries and sensors.  

===== Processors 
Tools designed primarily to accept and/or process data from other tools. This
includes data visualization tools and time series DB's as well as stream
processing systems and glue-projects.

===== Monoliths
Tools designed to be all-in-one solutions. It's probably possible to
import/export data from these tools, but they were designed to consume the data
that they, themselves collect. Most traditional operations-oriented
"monitoring" tools (eg openview, patrol, Nagios et. al) fit in this category.

==== Focus
What do you need your tool to actually monitor?

===== System Availability
These tools seek to answer the question: "Is it up?". Any tool that was
primarily designed to check for system or service availability at a one-minute
or greater resolution will be found here. Most classical operations-centric
monitoring tools like Nagios fall into this category.

===== App/DB Performance
APM Tools insert themselves into popular databases and language interpretors
for the purpose of analyzing their performance. This is usually done by
patching the interpretor or other binary with instrumentation code. These tools
can give very detailed performance data at a highly granular resolution on
databases like MySQL or even on custom apps by, for example, instrumenting the
JVM. Examples include New Relic, Appneta, and Vivid Cortex.

===== Networks
A broad class of tools designed to monitor and analyze network availability,
performance, and content. Packet taps, SNMP collectors, Netflow, and and SFlow
related tools can be found herein.

===== Data Processing
Tools in this category were designed to collect or accept ad-hoc metrics and
log data and do something useful with it, such as visualizing it (drawing
graphs), parsing it, transforming it, alerting on it, and possibly forwarding
it to other tools. Examples include Splunk, Heka, Graphite, Riemann and
Librato.

===== Storage Analysis
These tools specialize in analyzing SAN's and other distributed storage
technologies.

===== Platform-Specific
Tools in this category were created specifically to monitor a particular
platform, or a class of platforms. AWS Cloudwatch,Heroku metrics, and Rackspace
monitoring, all fall into this category

==== Ok, I think I know what I'm looking for, now what?
Each chapter in this book (besides this one) represents one taxonomic path. So
if you were looking for a traditional -> free/open -> monolithic ->
system_availability type tool, (which happens to be the most popular taxonomic
path (Nagios and its myriad clones (12 tools in all) categorize there)), you
would thumb to Chapter 5.

==== How did you choose the tools?
The initial list of tools I'm documenting were taken from James Turnbull's 2015
Monitoring Survey results, which you can see for yourself at
https://kartar.net/2015/08/monitoring-survey-2015---tools/. I'll be expanding
on that, and I'm also happy to take pull requests for new tools to include or
corrections to anything I've misrepresented.

Again, in this short-read you'll only find documented every _open-source_ tool
that has a minimum of two respondents in the Katar survey.  You can find the
rest of the tools (commercial, open-source and points in between, 62 in all) at
the github repo for this project at: http://github.com/librato/taxonomy

==== Why did you write this?

I wrote this because monitoring is a mess. 

What does it even mean!? _Monitoring_... I mean, what do you what to know?  Do
you want to know that the servers are up? Do you want to know the maximum of
the p95 request latency on your front-end API? Do you want to know that someone
left the back door open in your Albuquerque Datacenter? These are _very_
different problems. Each requires a very different set of tools and expertise,
and yet there's no way to categorically research any of these tools
independently of the others. They all somehow belong to the same category.

_Monitoring_

I find this confounding in the extreme -- the magnitude of our hand-wavey
imprecision in describing this discipline. Especially in the context of our
wholesale obsession with definition. _Every_ other engineering discipline in
the world is endlessly sub-categorizing itself into oblivion with increasingly
incomprehensible (but extremely precise) jargon. But nope, all of these tools
are just "monitoring tools" (he says, waving his hand in the general direction
of a massive assortment of _completely_ different tools).

When Science has a vast and incomprehensible landscape to make sense of, it
creates a taxonomy, and that's what I'd like to begin here. I want to direct
the attention of the overwhelmed engineer toward the subset of "monitoring"
tools that are likely to work for her problem domain in her corporate culture.
Like a map; something to augment your already well-developed sense of direction
and help you avoid stepping in anything too smelly.
