=== How does this book work?

This pamphlet categorizes and describes 25 different open-source monitoring
tools. I've used a hierarchal taxonomy composed of 5 taxa to categorize these
tools, and then I've provided a summary of each tool in the form of a small
questionnaire to give you a sense of how the tool does what it does, how well it
gets along with other tools, and how well it fits into your
environment/culture/stack.

==== The Taxa
There are four top-level categories, and each have a varying number of
classifications:

==== Operations Burden
Whom do you want to run your monitoring tool? The classifications are:

* Traditional
* Hosted
* Appliances and Sensors

==== Pay Model
How do you want to pay for your monitoring tool? The classifications are:

* Free/Open
* Commercial
* Freemium
* Free/Closed
* Subscription
* Hardware

This quick-read only includes the Free/Open taxa, but there's an extended
online version at http://github.com/librato/taxonomy that covers 62 tools
across all Pay Models.

==== Activity Model
Do you need a tool to collect measurements, or process measurements or both?

* Collectors
* Processors
* Monoliths

==== Focus
What do you need your tool to actually monitor?

* System Availability
* App/DB Performance
* Networks
* Log/Metric Processing
* Storage Analysis
* Platform-Specific

==== Great categories I guess, now what?
Like I said, the taxonomy is hierarchal, so from those top-level taxa we build
categorical paths like: traditional -> free/open -> monolithic ->
system_availability which happens to be the most popular taxonomic path (Nagios
and its myriad clones (12 tools in all) categorize there).

Not every possible path contains tools. In fact, the 62 total tools in the
online version categorize into only 25 different taxonomic paths.  Each path is
represented as a chapter in Part 2, and each tool is a section in the chapter
that corresponds to it's category. The TOC is very much your friend.

==== Why didn't you include awesome monitoring tool X?
Great question. The initial list of tools I'm documenting were taken from James Turnbull's 2015 Monitoring Survey results, which you can see for yourself at
https://kartar.net/2015/08/monitoring-survey-2015---tools/. I'll be expanding
on that, and I'm also happy to take PR's for new tools to include.

In this short-read you'll find documented every _open-source_ tool that has a
minimum of two respondents in the Katar survey.  You can find the rest of the
tools (commercial, open-source and points in between, 62 in all) at my github
repo for this project at: http://www.github.com/librato/taxonomy

==== How did you decide what tools to include?
See the question above.

==== Why is everything you said about awesome tool X wrong and also, how come you're stupid?
Sorry about that. This was a lot of research and it's not just possible but
probable that I've misrepresented something. I assure you, it wasn't personal,
and I'm happy to accept PR's on any of the description content and/or to
discuss re-categorization and the addition of new categories. Simply clone the
git-repo here: https://github.com/librato/taxonomy and shoot me an issue with
an accompanying PR. I badly want this to be a living, breathing community
project and I consider this to be only the beginning of the conversation.
