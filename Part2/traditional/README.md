#Paymodel
## How do you want to pay for your tool:

## [Free/Open](free_open) 
Opensource tools cost $0 to obtain and come with their source code. 

## [Commercial](commercial) 
Commercially licensed software often costs money to obtain (legally) and is
usually distributed in binary form. This category includes demo software and
software, hosted Saas that doesn't have a free-tier, and any other software
that's free-to-use for a limited time. This does not include nagware which is
free to use forever as long as you don't mind it nagging you every so often to
buy it.

## [Freemium](freemium) 
Freemium software is possibly open-source software with a paid premium
component or usage tier. You'll find most nagware and shareware in this
category along with SaaS tools that have a usable free tier. By *usable* we
mean the free tier provides the base-line operability one would expect. 

## [Free/Closed](free_closed) 
Closed-source software that doesn't cost money to obtain.
