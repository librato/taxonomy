# Kibana

## An open source, browser-based analytics dashboard for Elasticsearch

### What is it? 

Kibana is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch that provides numerous visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster.

### push, pull, both, or neither?

Kibana pulls data from Elasticsearch indices, while data is pushed to Elasticsearch from different sources.

### Measurement resolution 

Not applicable here since Kibana simply uses Elasticsearch indices.

### Data Storage 

Kibana needs 'dynamic mapping' to use fields in visualizations correctly, as well as to manage the .kibana index where saved searches, visualizations, and dashboards are stored.

### Analysis capabilities

With Kibana, you can create bar, line and scatter plots, or various charts and maps on top of volumes of Elasticsearch data.

You have access to every document in every index that matches your selected index pattern. Perform mathematical transformations, and manipulate the data as you see fit.
