# Operations Burden
## Who do you want to run your tool?

## [Traditional](traditional)
You like your monitoring software right where you can reboot it. Tools in this
category run on your servers. 

## [Hosted](hosted) 
You have enough to worry about without managing an in-house monitoring
infrastructure. Tools in this category include SaaS solutions, and any sort of
monitoring solution that is maintained by an external vendor (including tools
that use a locally-installed agent that reports to the cloud).

## [Appliances and Sensors](appliance)
Any type of hardware solution to include things like environmental sensors,
packet taps, and on-premise monitoring-server-in-a-box style solutions. If you
can throw it at someone in frustration, you'll find it in here.
