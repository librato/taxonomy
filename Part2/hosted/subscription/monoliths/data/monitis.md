# Monitis

## ALL the things

### What is it? 
Monitis is a site-oriented monitoring system that is generally focused on site
availability but has a little bit of everything going on. The primary service
uses geographically dispersed Monitis-owned servers to poll and collect
availability and response data on your publicly available websites.

Myriad agents are available to collect performance and availability data on
unix and windows hosts, network gear, appliations, and even RUM. Monitis is
very wide but not very deep.
