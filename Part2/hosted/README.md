# License/Payment Model
## How do you want to pay for your tool:

## [Subscription](subscription) 
Most hosted and SaaS monitoring tools are subscription based after a ~30 day
free trial period. 

## [Freemium](freemium) 
SaaS tools that have a *usable* free tier can be found here. By *usable* we
mean the free tier provides the base-line operability a resonable person would
consider running a small startup on.
