# Activity model
## What do you want your tool to do?

### [Collectors](collectors)
Tools designed primarily to measure things and make observations. This includes
things like monitoring agents, instrumentation libraries and sensors.

### [Processors](processors)
Tools designed primarily to accept and/or process data from other tools. This
includes data visualization tools and time series DB's as well as stream
processing systems and glue-projects. 

### [Monoliths](monoliths)
Tools designed to be all-in-one solutions. It's probably possible to
import/export data from these tools, but they were designed to consume the data
that they, themselves collect. Most traditional operations-oriented
"monitoring" tools (eg openview, patrol, Nagios et. al) fit in this category.
